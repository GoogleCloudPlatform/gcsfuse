Additional stat on each entry slows down the entire `ls` operation and may look like hang, but in reality is iterating one by one and slow. There are two ways to overcome this: <ul><li>**Get rid of `stat`:** Execute without coloring `ls --color=never` or `\ls` to remove the stat part of `ls`.</li> <li>**Improve the `stat` lookup time:** increase the metadata ([stat](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcsfuse-cache#stat-cache-overview) + [type](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcsfuse-cache#type-cache-overview)) cache ttl/capacity which is populated as part of listing and makes the `stat` lookup faster. Important to note here, `ls` will be faster from the first execution itself as cache is populated in listing phase, leading to quicker stat lookup for each entry.</li></ul> |
