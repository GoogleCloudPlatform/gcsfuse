| Cloud Storage FUSE get stuck when using it to concurrently work with a large number of opened files (reference issue [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/issues/1043))                      | This happens when gcsfuse is mounted with http1 client (default) and the application using gcsfuse tries to keep more than value of `--max-conns-per-host` number of files opened. You can try (a) Passing a value higher than the number of files you want to keep open to `--max-conns-per-host` flag. (b) Adding some timeout for http client connections using `--http-client-timeout` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

User can check specific errors by enabling logs with --debug_fuse and --debug_gcs flags. **Solution**: Provide roles/storage.objectAdmin role on the bucket.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
