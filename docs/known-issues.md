| GCSFuse can hang when repeatedly writing to the same file using gRPC.                                                                                                                                     | Applications that perform frequent writes to the same file may experience deadlocks.                                                                                                                                                                                | [#2784](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/issues/2784) |
| An "Input/Output error" can occur when repeatedly writing to an existing file using gRPC.                                                                                                                 | This can lead to data corruption or incomplete writes.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [#2783](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/issues/2783) |

| GCSFuse does not use machine-type passed from GKE CSI Driver (from GCSFuse v3.4.0, GKE cluster version 1.34.1-gke.x onwards)                                                                              | Optimized GCSFuse configs for high-performance machines will not be applied when using the GCSFuse GKE CSI driver.<br>**Workaround**: When using the GKE CSI driver, pass the machine type explicitly through gcsfuse mount-options: `machine-type=<MACHINE_TYPE>`. | [#3799](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/pull/3799) [#4083](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/issues/4083) |
| Object rename operations may fail or stall on the application side, resulting in 5xx errors in the GCSFuse logs. This issue is observed only under high QPS (greater than 1000 queries per second).     | **Workaround:** To fix this issue, disable the atomic rename API by passing the flag `--enable-atomic-rename-object=false` when mounting GCSFuse.                                                                                                                   ||

| Writing to a file fails with an Input/Output error on the application side, accompanied by 503 errors in the GCSFuse logs. This occurs when streaming writes are enabled. | This issue was caused by stalls during write operations. It has been resolved in GCSFuse v3.3.0. Users should upgrade to v3.3.0 or later. **Workaround:** Disable streaming writes (`--enable-streaming-writes=false`) only if user can't upgrade. This flag reliably prevents the error only when used on VMs with Local SSDs. |v3.3.0||
