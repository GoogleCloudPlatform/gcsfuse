# Params structure
# flag-name: Name of the CLI flag.
# config-path: Location of the param in the config file. A value of "gcs-auth.anonymous-access" indicates that the param will be present under the gcs-auth:anonymous-access.
# type: data type of the param - supports the following values: ["int", "float64", "bool", "string", "duration", "octal", "[]int",
#			"[]string", "logSeverity", "protocol", "resolvedPath"]
# usage: The usage doc that will appear in the helpdoc
# default: The default value of the param.
# deprecated: Specifies whether the param is deprecated. This will cause warnings when the user specifies the flag.
# deprecationWarning: The warning that should be issued when the user specifies a deprecated flag.
# hide-flag: Whether to hide flag from the helpdoc.
#
# The params must be kept sorted in ascending order.
# The linear order between any two params, p1 and p2 is defined as following:
# 1. If p1.config-path != "" && p2.config-path != "" then p1 < p2 iff p1.config-path < p2.config-path else p2 < p1
# 2. If p1.config-path == "" && p2.config-path == "" then p1 < p2 iff p1.flag-name < p2.flag-name else p2 < p1
# 3. If p1.config-path != "" && p2.config-path == "" then p1 < p2 and vice versa.
