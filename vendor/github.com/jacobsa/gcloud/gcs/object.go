	// NOTE(jacobsa): As of 2015-06-03, the official GCS documentation for this
	// property (https://goo.gl/GwD5Dq) says this:
	//
	//     Newly uploaded objects have a component count of 1, and composing a
	//     sequence of objects creates an object whose component count is equal
	//     to the sum of component counts in the sequence.
	//
	// However, in Google-internal bug 21572928 it was clarified that this
	// doesn't match the actual implementation, which can be documented as:
	//
	//     Newly uploaded objects do not have a component count. Composing a
	//     sequence of objects creates an object whose component count is equal
	//     to the sum of the component counts of the objects in the sequence,
	//     where objects that do not have a component count are treated as having
	//     a component count of 1.
	//
	// This is a much less elegant and convenient rule, so this package emulates
	// the officially documented behavior above. That is, it synthesizes a
	// component count of 1 for objects that do not have a component count.
