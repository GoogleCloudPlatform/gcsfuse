# Install fuse before installing our code.
before_install:
  - sudo apt-get install -qq fuse

# All of our dependencies are in the repo, so we don't need to run `go get`.
# Doing so is actually harmful as of 2015-07-27, because of
# http://golang.org/issue/11864. So use the `true` command to do nothing for
# the install step.
install: true

# HACK(jacobsa): Here is how Travis fetches our code:
#
#  *  Clone the git repo into a temporary location.
#  *  Check out the commit of interest.
#  *  rsync the git repo to $GOPATH/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse
#
# Note that the directory name is camel case, instead of `googlecloudplatform`,
# as used in our code to import sub-packages.
#
# Normally this is papered over by the fact that the default `install` step for
# go does `go get -v ./...` from within  that directory. That winds up fetching
# another copy into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse`, so
# the imports resolve correctly. (But this is bad! We get the wrong versions if
# commits are pushed quickly.)
#
# However we disabled the install step above, so this doesn't happen and
# instead we get errors like the following:
#
#     mount.go:25:2: cannot find package "github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/fs" in any of:
#             /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/vendor/github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/fs (vendor tree)
#             /home/travis/.gimme/versions/go/src/github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/fs (from $GOROOT)
#             /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/fs (from $GOPATH)
#
# Fix this by renaming the directory before testing.
script:
  - cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/
  - mv GoogleCloudPlatform googlecloudplatform
  - go test -v github.com/googlecloudplatform/gcsfuse/...
