class Controller:
  """Class that controls the outer loop of model training and evaluation.

  Orbit divides training and evaluation into "inner" and "outer" loops. Inner
  loops are implemented by users in the form of `AbstractTrainer` and
  `AbstractEvaluator` subclasses, and define how to run a given number of
  training or evaluation steps. The outer loop is provided by this `Controller`,
  and interleaves calls to the user-provided inner loops with additional actions
  such as saving checkpoints, running evaluations, writing summaries, as well as
  (optionally) user provided `Action`s (see below).

  There are four top-level "outer loops" provided:

    - `train`, which trains until a specified number of global steps is reached;
    - `evaluate`, for one-off model evaluation;
    - `train_and_evaluate`, for interleaved training and evaluation;
    - `evaluate_continuously`, for monitoring a given directory and running
      evaluations on new model checkpoints.

  While this class attempts to provide out-of-the-box solutions for common
  training and evaluation use cases, the internal details and method
  implementations are also intended to be simple enough to make subclassing or
  other custom outer loop implementations easy to achieve.

  Some additional customization can be achieved by supplying `train_actions` or
  `eval_actions` when constructing the `Controller`. Actions arbitrary callables
  that are applied by the `Controller` to the output of train steps (after each
  inner loop of `steps_per_loop` steps) or an evaluation. This provides a hook
  mechanism, enabling things like reporting metrics to Vizier, model exporting,
  additional logging, etc. See the `orbit.actions` package for a small handful
  of predefined actions and some utility classes that may be useful in defining
  your own.

    Note that if `checkpoint_manager` is provided and there are checkpoints in
    the associated model directory, the model will be restored from the most
    recent checkpoint during this `__init__` method.

    Args:
      global_step: An integer `tf.Variable` storing the global training step
        number. Usually this can be obtained from the `iterations` property of
        the model's optimizer (e.g. `trainer.optimizer.iterations`). In cases
        where multiple optimizers are used, or if one model "step" corresponds
        to more than one update to model parameters, users can create and
        increment their own global step variable as well. In this case it is
        recommended to create the `tf.Variable` inside the distribution strategy
        scope, with `aggregation=tf.VariableAggregation.ONLY_FIRST_REPLICA` (see
        also `orbit.utils.create_global_step()`).
      trainer: An instance of `orbit.AbstractTrainer`, which implements the
        inner training loop.
      evaluator: An instance of `orbit.AbstractEvaluator`, which implements
        evaluation.
      strategy: An instance of `tf.distribute.Strategy`. If not provided, the
        strategy will be initialized from the current in-scope strategy using
        `tf.distribute.get_strategy()`.
      train_actions: Optional `orbit.Action`s to call after each block of
        `steps_per_loop` training steps are run. These will be called with the
        output of `trainer.train`.
      eval_actions: Optional `orbit.Action`s to call after each evaluation.
        These will be called with the output of `evaluator.evaluate`.
      steps_per_loop: The number of steps to run in each inner loop of training
        (passed as the `num_steps` parameter of `trainer.train`).
      checkpoint_manager: An instance of `tf.train.CheckpointManager`. If
        provided and there are checkpoints in the associated model directory,
        the model will be restored from the most recent checkpoint inside this
        `__init__` method. If not provided, the `Controller` will not
        automatically save to or restore from checkpoints.
      summary_interval: Step interval for training summaries. Note that this
        argument only applies to `tf.summary` calls inside the `trainer.train`
        function. Summaries written by the `Controller` (specifically
        "steps_per_second" and output from the `trainer.train` method) will
        always be enabled unless the `summary_dir` parameter is `None`. If set,
        the value must be divisible by `steps_per_loop`.
      summary_dir: The directory to write summaries to. To use the same
        directory as for checkpointing, pass `checkpoint_manager.directory`. If
        `None`, no training summaries will be written.
      eval_summary_dir: The directory to write eval summaries to. If `None`, it
        will be set to `summary_dir`. If both `summary_dir` and
        `eval_summary_dir` are `None`, no eval summaries will be written.

    Raises:
      ValueError: If both `trainer` and `evaluator` are `None`.
