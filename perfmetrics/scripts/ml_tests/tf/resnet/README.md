# Kokoro test for tf model reliability using gcsfuse

This readme contains file descriptions, libraries and model used for the test.

## Test description

* We have used tf2.10 framework along with tf-model-garden library (v2.10) 
for [resnet18](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfmodels/vision/image_classification) based reliability testing on ImageNet dataset for 3000 epochs
which runs for roughly 14 days.

## Packages required

* The [TensorFlow Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) is a repository with a number of different 
implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and modeling solutions for TensorFlow users.

* [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for running deep learning container based image.

* [Nvidia drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html#runfile) for using gpu.
We have used driver version 450.172.01 for experiments.

## File description

* build.sh: Entrypoint for kokoro vm. Runs setup_host.sh for installing required nvidia drivers
and docker engine. And starts experiment using setup_scripts/Dockerfile as container image

* Dockerfile: Uses Deep learning container tf as a base image.

* setup_container.sh: Entrypoint for the Docker container. Installs gcsfuse and tf-model-garden
library and starts the experiment in the container

* resnet_runner.py: python script for running resnet18 model using tf-model-garden library.

## Config changes for running model

In resnet_runner.py, batch_size can be adjusted on line 34 and number of epochs for the training can be specified in call
to tfm.core.train_lib.run_experiment at line 100

## Logging
4 hours of GCSFuse logs with debug flags: --debug_fuse, --debug_gcs take around 40 GiB of space on disk.
The gcsfuse based logs are stored in directory ${KOKORO_ARTIFACTS_DIR}/github/gcsfuse/container_artifacts/logs
while the gcsfuse errors and output (Mounted successfully) are stored in ${KOKORO_ARTIFACTS_DIR}/github/gcsfuse/container_artifacts/output
